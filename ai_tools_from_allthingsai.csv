So you can spend more time experimenting and testing out your own models.

Once youâve picked your presenter, you can then customise them even more. Deciding on the language, voice and style youâd like to move forward with. Depending on the voice you pick, the style options change too. For instance if you click on Sara, her styles are more emotion focused. Perfect if you want to create a character who is empathetic or excited. But if you choose Aria, her styles are slightly different. As well as being emotion focused, her style also includes task based styles like customer service, narration and newscast . When I was using Creative Reality Studio this caught me out a few times. I had decided on a voice but the style I needed wasnât available for the chosen voice, so make sure you check this before committing! There are many different voices you can pick from, but unfortunately quite a few of them fall under the paid memberships, so youâll have to pay up if you want full access to the voice library. What happens if the voice options donât tickle your fancy? Donât fret, you can even upload your own voice to the platform, so you can create even more realistic portraits . A great option instead of having to rerecord something! Once youâre happy with your chosen presenter, simply include your script, click generate and youâll have your AI portrait in a matter of seconds, itâs pretty crazy. D-ID AI have also created something called Chat.D-ID , a tool that allows you to have conversations with ChatGPT, face-to-face.

There are three different memberships for Creative Reality Studio, these include Lite - $5.9/month, Pro - $49/month or Advanced - $299/month . Thereâs quite a price jump between memberships, so make sure you do your research. When it comes to Chaat.D-ID, you get six chats for free, once youâve used all of these up you can upgrade to get 1000 chats each month for $2.99 , which isnât too bad!

769,Undetectable AI,Writing,"A lot of us now use AI-generated content, why shouldnât we? It saves us time, it helps us be more productive and 9/10 of ten the generated content is pretty decent. But, with the rise of AI content comes the increase of AI content detectors. Platforms created to pull you up on your AI-generated content. Now, this is where Undetectable AI comes in. Undetectable AI helps you bypass these detectors by maintaining a natural and human-like quality. Itâs a powerful tool. With registration you receive 250 free words to test out the platform. I imagine youâll get through that quite quickly, so donât stress. Undetectable do offer paid plans, so youâll be able to get back to testing out your text. Now, when it comes to the plans, Undetectable AI are doing it differently. Instead of paying an amount each month for a plan that may not fully be suitable, the Undetectable AI let you pick how many words per month you need and give you a price for that. For example, if you reckon 10,000 words per month will do you, that will set you back $9.99/per month . If youâre writing a novel, maybe 80,000 words would be more suitable, this will cost you $64/per month . No matter how many words you end up going for, youâll still have access to email support, writing level matching, high quality, legible content and much more included in the plan. It really feels like Undetectable AI is working with you and not against you. When it comes to testing your copy and checking for AI, this is super easy to do. Copy and paste your text and agree to the terms of service. Here, you can either âCheck for AIâ or â Humanizeâ the text. Check for AI will run through your text and assess the likelihood of AI. Youâll be shown a range of different AI platforms (OpenAI, Writer, Copyleaks etc), and depending on the colour of that platform youâll be able to understand if anything has been detected. Red means itâs been flagged that the text is 0% human, Orange is 50% human and Green is 100% human. A super quick and easy way to understand if your text will be flagged by the AI detectors out there. Once youâve tested out where your text is coming out on the detection scale, try clicking on âHumanizeâ. This is where Undetectable AI will add more of a human touch to your text, making it fly under the detectorâs radar. Itâs pretty cool! You can even customise this to fit the tone of voice that you want to achieve. You can change the readability from high school all the way up to Doctorate and more. You can even specify the purpose of the text so if youâre writing a business paper or cover letter, youâre covered. Overall, Undetectable AI is fairly accurate when it comes to rewriting your content to pass AI detection. It provides a pretty good picture of whether or not your text passes AI detection and shares copy alternatives, so you can fly through detection plain sailing.",PAID,$10,https://undetectable.ai?ref=allthingsai.com

The platform promises to be able to reworkÂ AI-generated content, making it undetectable by AI detection software. To try this out, I asked ChatGPT for a 200-word article on the history of the cupcake. I took that content, and then plugged it into GPTZero to see how it scored; it came back 57% likely to have been created by a machine. Next, I opened up Word AIâs Avoid AI Detection tool, which has a very simple interface. After pasting the cupcake text, I let the process run, which took just a few moments. I then put the rewritten content back through GPTZero. This time the score was 49% likely AI-generated. I then moved over to the Rewrite Articles feature, and here WordAI was much more impressive. Not only did it rework the cupcake piece into a very good alternative, it also provided additional variations, allowing me to pick the one I liked best. When I hovered over the original paragraphs, WordAI highlighted the corresponding section in the rewritten piece, making it easy to see how things had been changed.",PAID,$17,https://wordai.com/?ref=allthingsai.com

If you canât find the character you want to talk to, why not create them yourself? Include the character's name, profile picture, and short bio, and get chatting. For me when it came to building your own character, I felt more details and options could have been included in this section. For instance, if you donât include something in the bio, it wonât be picked up. It would be nice if ChatFAI gave you some prompts and inspiration for what to include in the bio section. I would have also liked to have seen a few drop-down options on character personality, traits, conversation types - to help bring a bit more depth and life to the character youâre creating. ChatFAI do have a long list of different pre-made character categories that you can choose from, these include: AI assistance, Anime/Manga, Book, Cartoon, Comic, Education, Game, History, other, real person, religion, TV show and movies .

They are created extremely quickly, which is a pro and you are given a wide range of different logo options to play with, another pro. But, the quality of the logos didnât hit the mark for me.

I added my text to the summariser, along with with my OpenAI key, clicked ââ¨Summarizeâ and waited and waited and waitedâ¦ I never received a summary. So I tried summarising my YouTube video, and then my Twitter Threads, no luck. It would be great if the Summarize This team included helpful notifications, to help you understand this process a little more. Was I doing something wrong? Was the platform facing troubles? There was no answer. After hundreds of tries, the tool finally summarised my text! I got there in the end, but I didnât feel like I had saved any time. The quality of the summary was ok. I did run through it and felt like some important things were missing. Remember to take all AI summarisation tools with a pinch of salt!",FREE,,https://summarizethis.io/?ref=allthingsai.com

Maybe youâve encountered challenges when it comes to navigating model release forms, and security and privacy laws that come with it. It can be tough to obtain approval of image usage and it can really slow things down. Or maybe you have a vision of someone in your head, but you canât seem to find the right model to move forward withâ¦ Say hello to LucidPic. LucidPic is an AI image generator platform that allows you to generate high-quality stock images of people who donât exist, talk about wild! You can generate the perfect person for your needs. Customize their clothing, hair length, age, pose, and emotion , you get the gist! It feels like youâre building your very own SIM. You can even pick the photo style, from standard to cinematic or candid to fantasy (this is included in the Pro membership). To do this, you will have to sign in with a Google account but once you have, you can get straight to generating the perfect character. Itâs extremely easy to do and I didnât find it complicated at all. Once I was happy with the customizations, I clicked âgenerate characterâ and 30 seconds later, there was my perfect person! I was extremely impressed with the quality of the generated image. How had an AI just created a real human being?! Nothing felt off about the image at all. It was highly detailed , included all of my customizations, and just felt completely real. I was pretty blown away by the quality and precision of the generated image. But, there are a few things that I feel need a little improvement. For instance, the options in the customization categories are quite limited. When it came to customizing the hair, you could only pick the hair length (short, medium, long), you couldnât pick the style. When it comes to picking the expression, you can only pick from 5 different emotions. It would be great to see LucidPic add even more options to play around with. They do have an â Custom prompts â tool that allows the user to include custom keywords to alter the image, but this feature is only included in the Pro membership. Another feature I like is the â Your Character â history page. Here, you can keep an eye on all of the characters you have generated in the past. When it comes to pricing, LucidPic have a few different memberships to choose from. You can start with the Free membership that includes 3 free generations per month. Now, if you find yourself wanting to generate more, the Basic membership at $4/month might be more up your street. This includes 500 generations/month, commercial usage, private images, more styles and HD upscaling. And if that still isnât enough for you try out the Pro membership at $20/month.

QuickVid allows you to do all your editing in one place. This means the look and feel of your videos are nice and consistent. When creating videos in the past, Iâve had to use several different platforms to create captions, the type of imagery I wanted or to edit music.

All you need to do is include a little information on what you want your video to be about, upload a few assets and it will do the rest for you. Even though youâre adding prompts to help curate your videos, I did feel that the videos were still quite generic. Of course, this may have been the prompts I shared (creating a useful and efficient prompt is a skill in itself!), but I was expecting a more authentic and unique approach to the creation of my videos. Normally, you can use QuickVid for free. But due to high demand the free version is no longer available. There are three paid memberships to choose from, Starter at $10/month , Professional at $20/month or Unlimited at $70/month .

839,Chai AI,Artificial Intelligence,"Chai AI was created to give you a safe space to have as many interesting and unique conversations as you want, with whoever you want ! Chai AI provides you with a whole range of different chatbots that you can engage with via app and web . Perfect if youâre a chatterbox, a storyteller or even looking for a new friend! It works in a similar way to other chatbot platforms, so youâll be able to pick it up in no time. Simply download the app, create an account and get chatting. There are so many different chatbots to choose from. When I say that some of the bots are quite niche, I mean it. You could be talking to a Librarian, to Tom Riddle (otherwise know as Voldemort) or even a Vampire! If you canât find the right bot for you, donât worry, you can create your own. Decide on the category your bot falls into, their personality traits and their type of greeting. It almost feels like youâre building a Sim! When it comes to the conversation side of things, Chai AI provide you with 70 free messages each day. Which isnât actually that many messages, especially if youâre trying to figure out why Tom Riddle decided to go after Harryâs parentsâ¦ If youâre finding that youâre flying through the 70 messages you can upgrade to a Premium membership. The Premium membership will set you back Â£12.49/month . This membership includes unlimited messages, unlimited bots and no ads. There are a lot of ads on the app, so if you canât stand them, upgrading may be a good idea. From a safety point of view, Chai AI have got your back. They donât share your data with companies or organisations, data is fully encrypted in transit and you can even request for your data to be deleted, so your data is for your eyes only. One of the things that I didnât like about the platform is that some of the chatbots are quite controversial/overly sexualised and quite dark. There doesnât seem to be anyone monitoring this. It feels like anyone can upload any type of chatbot character, which makes me feel a bit uncomfortable. Saying this, the age restriction of the platform is 17+, but at no point in the sign up journey do you need to prove your age. I think the Chai AI team could and should be stricter on this. If you want to have an engagement with ANY type of chatbot character, then Chai AI is the place. You can really get your creativity flowing here!",PAID,$14,https://www.chai-research.com/?ref=allthingsai.com

These energy points do recharge over time, but if you do find yourself using up your energy tokens quickly you can always upgrade your membership.

You can even decide on the type of aspect ratio and quality of your generated image as well as enhancing an upscaling the image too.

841,Inferkit,Chatbots,"InferKit is a clean text-generation app, designed to literally pick up where you have left off. Essentially, you type in a sentence or two, and InferKitâs AI builds on what you have written. For my test, I decided to see whether I could get InferKit to help me write a version of Goldilocks and the Three Bears. I started the story with âGoldilocks walked through the woods where,â and I then asked InferKit to generate some text. Hereâs how the opening read after InferKit had chimed in: âGoldilocks walked through the woods where she discovered a cabin and a girl named Trixie, a witch by day and an arsonist by night.â As you can see, the story was taking quite a troubling journey, so I decided to try a more oblique tale. I began with âThe young boy was happy to see that it was a sunny day.â InferKit then built on it, leaving me with: âThe young boy was happy to see that it was a sunny day. So was I as I saw that the sun would be shining at a bright blue sky. There was a faint layer of cloud, but it didn't look threatening. The boy in the sandals wore beige shorts, a green t - shirt.â For my last test, I opted to try and get the InferKit to write me an email. I also wanted it to include a specific word, which you can prompt it to do via the Generate Options section. I asked for the email to include âspreadsheet,â and then started the sentence with âDear business manager, I am writing to you to tell you all about my company, whichâ¦â After InferKit got to work, my email became: âDear business manager, I am writing to you to tell you all about my company, which provides office space and all kinds of different services to businesses. Like many business owners, I am budgeting the most for the first month and hoping to have my expenses completely covered byâ¦â As youâll note, InferKit trailed off at the end, and the word âspreadsheetâ didnât appear once.",PAID,$20,https://inferkit.com/?ref=allthingsai.com
842,Meta Voice Studio,Audio,"Creating voiceovers can sometimes be a real hassle. You have to find the right voice model for your needs, book a recording studio, find dates that work for everyone. It can be a real logistical nightmare. And the cherry on top of the cake, it can be pricey. This is where Meta Voice Studio comes in. Meta Voice Studio is a high-quality AI voiceover generator , that lets you generate professional voiceovers without the hassle. To use the tool you will need to create an account. Once youâve got your account up and running you can get straight into creating the perfect voiceover for your needs. You can use the tool for free but there are some limits on the free plan. With the free plan you have access to 8 voice avatars , can convert up to 30 seconds of audio per request , 5 minutes total conversion per month, additional minutes at $0.30 per minute , file upload and you can only use it for personal. If you want a few more options to play with and youâre creating voiceovers on a regular basis, then signing up to a paid plan may be better suited to you. The Meta Voice Studio personal plan at $10/month , includes 42 voice avatars , can convert up to 5 minutes of audio per request, 30 minutes total conversion per month, additional minutes at $0.30 per minute , file uploads, API access and a commercial license. If that still doesnât fit the bill, try out the creator plan. This includes the same goodies as the personal plan but with an increase of 25 minutes of audio per request and 24 hours total conversion per month, you can also start voice cloning with this plan. Ok, so youâve now figured out the best plan for you and your needs. Letâs get to generating your voiceover. Thereâs two ways to get the ball rolling here. Either, speak into your microphone and record what you would like your voice model to say, or upload an audio file. Just a flag, that this audio can be no longer than thirty seconds or bigger than 10MB (free plan). I had to cut down my recordings a fair bit to fit these rules. Once youâve recorded or uploaded your audio, itâs time to pick your AI Model. For the free plan you only have 8 Models to choose from, so choose wisely! You can preview the voices before committing but unfortunately the voices all seem quite similar. Thereâs no real change in voice age or accent which is a shame. Iâm hoping Meta Voice Studio are working on this in the background and hopefully weâll see a bit more diversity on the tool soon. When I first used Meta Voice Studio the voiceover generator took at least 20 minutes to generate. This really put me off. Weâre now all so used to things being super fast in the AI space. Weâve been spoilt by quick generators, speedy creators and rapid chatbots. The platform flagged that the servers for the free tier were busy and that maybe a paid plan should be considered. I found this a little cheeky, but if youâre willing to pay for the goods, this will really benefit you! It would also be great to be able to customize the voiceover in the free plan. At the moment, once the voiceover has been generated, thatâs it. Thereâs no option to edit it. I was surprised by the quality of the voice recordings, they felt professional and high quality. They were a lot better than I expected! But remember, if you want a super high quality voice over, you WILL have to share a super high quality recording with Meta Voice Studio so it can work itâs magic.",PAID,$10,https://studio.themetavoice.xyz/?ref=allthingsai.com

Stable Diffusion is a recently developed text-to-image AI model that uses deep learning to create super high-quality images directly from your prompts and descriptions. And when I say high-quality, I mean it. Make sure you create a Mage Space account so you can get get generating. If youâve used an AI image generation platform before the interface will be familiar to you. As well as text-to-image generation, Mage Space also offers image-to-image generation. It allows you to integrate you prompt with your shared image which is pretty cool. Include your image prompt in the generation bar, decide on the type of style and model youâd like to move forward with, give it a minute and youâll have your generated image ready and waiting. Once your image has been generated, it is automatically made âpublicâ. Other creators can like, follow and add comments to your art, pretty similar to the Instagram model. Donât worry, if you want to keep your creations to yourself, simply tick the âprivateâ box and theyâll be for your eyes only. If youâre looking for some AI art inspo, Mage Space have an explore page that you can sift through to help get your creative juices flowing. Now if that isnât enough for you, you can also join the Mage Space server. This is a great server to join if youâre new to Mage Space or the AI image generation space. There are channels for learning how to use Mage Space, resources and FAQs, so youâll find out everything you need on this server. You can use Mage Space for free (hooray!).

It doesnât matter if youâre a designer, a content creative or even an artist. Dezgo will help turn your vision into reality. You donât need an account to get started, but if you want to take full advantage of what Dezgo has to offer, you might want to set one up. Itâs really simple to use, the interface isnât complicated and youâre not overwhelmed by loads of different settings/buttons. This is ideal if you want to generate an image with no distractions. Include your prompt, pick a Model and click run. In a few seconds, youâll be presented with your AI generated image. Now, if thatâs sounds too simple for you, donât worry. You can provide a bit more detail in the âMore Optionsâ dropdown. Here, you can choose the image resolution and provide a ânegativeâ prompt. This is where you lay out all of the things you donât want included in your generated image. Iâve not come across this approach before and I think itâs great! Just an FYI there are a few extra features in this section that you will have to pay for. Now, if the text-to-image isnât working for you, or you just canât seem to get those prompts down, donât worry! Dezgo also offer an image-to-image generator . Upload an image and Dezgo will use this as inspiration. Itâs pretty great, but if you want to create something specific, youâll have to call this out in the prompts. Letâs get into pricing. Dezgo is free, but there is a pay-as-you-go Power mode option that gives you access to a few more features. If you deposit $10 into your Dezgo account, youâll get your hands on 5263 images (text-to-image)/558 images (text-to-image XL) depending what you go for. One really cool benefit of paying for the Power Mode membership is that your request bypasses the generator queue and is processed immediately. So thereâs no waiting around for your images. You can also generate up to four versions of an image (Midjourney offer something similar), I love this feature because you have more options to choose from. Instead of having to go back and generate another image that fits the bill, youâll normally find a version that youâre happy with within these 4 options. And finally you have full access to all 79 AI Models and unlock the rest of the tool parameters. When it came to the prompts, I quickly learned that you have to be extremely specific and share as much detail as possible with Dezgo. With many other AI image generator tools you can be quite vague and they normally present you with something that isnât too far from what you imagined. But with Dezgo, you really need to hold itâs hand. I found that things were missed even if I did specifically call something out in my prompt. I know the Dezgo team are always working on developing the tool, so fingers crossed that theyâll nail this soon. Dezgo is big on customisatonalisation . They have a whole bunch of editing tools that allow you to tweak the final output if needed. From changing the colour of the generated image, to even mixing up the background, you can do it all in one place.

Once youâve got an account, getting up and running couldnât be easier. If youâve not used something similar before, make sure to dive into the âgetting-startedâ channel to get up to speed on all things BlueWillow. In a matter of 5 simple steps, you can generate four AI images - itâs pretty wild. BlueWillow is being marketed as the âfree Midjourney alternativeâ and for a lot of you eagle-eyed out there, youâll probably understand why. There are quite a few similarities that the two platforms share. For instance, both platforms are only accessible through Discord and use the same command to generate an image (â/imagineâ). So if youâve used MidJourney before, youâll definitely be able to use BlueWillow. The big difference is the price. When it comes to BlueWillow you have 25 free image prompts per day to run wild with. Once you have run out of your âfreeâ MidJourney credits, you must buy a subscription (monthly subscription ranging from $10-$60). It may take less than a minute to generate the images themselves, but it does take some time to nail down an approach to creating efficient prompts for BlueWillow. If my prompt is âa cat wearing a hat, in the sunâ and Iâm not happy with the image. I can only be annoyed at myself. Itâs important to include as much detail as possible in the prompt that you are giving to BlueWillow. For instance, what type of cat is it? Is it a specific colour? Where is the cat? What colour is the hat? What style do I want the image in? You get the gist! Take a bit of time to figure out the right prompts for the types of images you want to generate. Unfortunately for me, Iâm no Picasso - I really struggle bringing my ideas to life. So BlueWillow is just what I needed. The discord channel is a great source for inspiration and learning too. You can peak into what others are creating and take notes on the types of prompts theyâre using.

Once youâve generated your image you can save it out to a handful of different formats PNG, JPG, SVG and PDF . So whatever your needs, itâs got you sorted.

It aims to be the easiest to use compared to the alternatives on the market and provides a simple interface on an Apple, Android, desktop or browser app. It's it also features an API where developers can replicate edits at scale like background changes. There are two distinct feature sets on PicWish. The first is photo editing . We used these tools to enlarge, compress, crop, and convert image file types. PicWish is everything most people need to be posting professional-level photos on social media. Their second toolset is AI-powered editing , and it allows us to remove backgrounds, unwanted objects, and unblurry faces, enhance our photos, colorize black and white images, and insert white backgrounds.

There are no tricks to optimize the tool. It's a simple upload and download. Take or leave. If you donât like it, thereâs not much you can do about it. An example is when we tried using the colorizer on the famous old picture of workers having lunch at the Rockefeller Center in New York City in 1932. The results werenât great, and overall ended with a sepia hue - rather than a photo in color. Overall, this isn't radically new for AI, mainly because we've seen these features in many forms before, such as Adobe Photoshop, Canva, and many others, without considering the native photo editing tools already on your phone. But there are two exciting bits are related to the form factor. The first is that all of these features are stuffed into their Android and Apple apps, which means that you don't have to open a laptop to edit any photo. You snap the picture with your phone, edit it with PicWish, and post it on social media. The app currently has over +1M downloads and potentially a few million users.

To avoid this, try and upload a high quality product image. Once youâre happy with the removal of the background, youâll be able to generate a new background for your product shot.

Meet Jamie. Jamie is the AI-meeting assistant you have been longing for . It automatically creates summaries of meetings, so you donât have to.

This is the problem that HeyGen (which used to be known as Movio) promises to fix. HeyGen is an AI-powered video creation platform that lets you make unique talking-heads clips. When you load up the app, you are presented with several options, including the ability to generate a âTalkingPhotoâ video, or to begin with one of HeyGenâs avatars. TalkingPhoto lets you create an AI-generated image (similar to Midjourney or Stable Diffusion)Â that you can then turn into an animated video. I opted to start with an avatar, and selected one from the dozen pre-created characters that were available. These include a few fun ones, including Mona Lisa and William Shakespeare, though premium customers have access to a larger range of avatars. You can customize several elements before you create your clip, including the format (landscape or portrait), and your avatarâs voice. Again, there are more options for premium users, and even the ability to clone your own voice for a one-off fee of $99. Here, I went with a free voice and then input the text that I wanted the character to say. You can of course upload your own audio, but youâll have to be mindful of your videoâs runtime, as each time you generate a video, you use credits; the longer the clip, the more credits youâll use. HeyGen gives you a voice preview feature which is helpful for checking how your avatar will sound before you create the end clip, and when you press render, the wait time is also mercifully quick. The end-result is a very good animated video, which, while not quite able to get over the uncanny valley, is more than good enough for an explainer video, presentation, or even a social media response clip.

1463,Genmo,Artificial Intelligence,"Genmoâs first-generation AI text-to-video platform has been around for a little while, but now the company is pushing things further with a more powerful version two. Presented as a messaging-style app (itâs actually called Genmo Chat), youâre greeted with a text box and some suggested prompts to get you started. But if you look just below the text input area, youâll see that, alongside video, you now have options for creating still images, 3D meshes, and GIFs. And with the generous bundle of daily credits (or in Genmoâs lingo, âfuelâ) you can really kick the tires on what Genmo can do. I started by asking Genmo to generate a couple of looping videos showing a chimpanzee playing drums (because we would all pay to go to see that band), and set the AI running. It took some time to process my request, but I didnât mind so much as the visual previews were interesting to observe as the AI slowly turned a cloudy, colorful mess into a pair of pretty well-crafted videos of drumming chimps. There was some of the melty-merging that you sometimes see with AI-generated video, but considering the complexity of the prompt, it was still very good. Genmo was less successful when I asked it to create two still images of chimps sitting at drum kits. The results were almost passable, but it seemed to struggle with the drum sticks, creating strange globs, and even placing a stick outside of one of the chimpâs hands. Personally, Iâd say dedicated AI art apps like Dall E-2 are better at this sort of thing, though I appreciate results may vary from prompt to prompt. One thing that is not subjective is geometry, and on this front, Genmoâs abilities definitely have some way to go. I asked the AI to create two 3D meshes of a basketball. The result? A very bumpy basketball that probably wouldnât bounce, and a sneaker (?) that was lacking a tongue. Lastly, the GIF tool wasnât working for me. That might be user error, but I couldnât get it to do much.",PAID,$10,https://www.genmo.ai/chat?ref=allthingsai.com

They have a âMatch Scaleâ that helps you understand how certain a match actually is. This ranges from Certain match - 90 to 100, Confident match - 83 to 89, Uncertain Match - 70 to 82 and Weak Match - 50-69, so youâll quickly be able to see and understand if there is any comparison. If you notice that your image appears in a search and you would would like it to be removed, you can request to get it taken down from the site, free of charge (if suitable). This is a real positive step from FaceCheck.ID , they want to be trusted by you and also want to make sure that youâre fully comfortable . Safety is key when it comes to this kind of thing.

What should you do/not do with this information? It would be great to see them create a document of useful resources that you can use to help support you in the next phase. FaceCheck.ID is free and accessible to all, every one deserves peace of mind on the internet! However, relying solely on FaceCheck.ID is not recommended.

Itâs an extremely easy tool to set up, simply download the Google Chrome extension, sign in with your Google account, include payment details, open a YouTube video and get summarising. The Eightify team do offer a free trial but this only lasts 7 days. Once this runs out, you will have to sign up to a paid plan.
